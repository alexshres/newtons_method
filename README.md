# Newton's Method

Just messing around with Newton's method and newton's method using synthetic
division. This only works with polynomials and not nonlinear functions. The
synthetic division based newton's method will find all roots. I thought about
using a tolerance to get the root but NM converges pretty quickly for
polynomials so I implemented based on some fixed number of iterations which
currently is 50 right now.
